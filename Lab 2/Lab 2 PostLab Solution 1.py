'''
A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions 
that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers, as defined in the below sample programs:
median.py
mode.py
Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean, 
which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function should expect a list of 
numbers as an argument and return a single number. Each function should return 0 if the list is empty. 
Include a main function that tests the three statistical functions with a given list.
